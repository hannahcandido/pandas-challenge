Summary
•	Primary objective is to analyze data from 15 unique high schools- 7 district and 8 Charter.
•	Charter schools had the lowest student count, while district schools had the largest student count.
•	School size did not necessary influence per capita spending; Baliey High School per capita was the highest and is coincidentally also the school with the highest student count; second highest- Cabrera High School came in 9th place under student count- so student count did not seem to have a direct impact on per capita spending.
•	I filtered the dataframe under ‘per_school_summary_filtered’ to show performance by school type, and Charter schools seem to have higher overall passing rates than  District schools.
•	I also filtered the data frame under ‘budget_per_student_filtered’ to show the correlation between the school size and budget and it seems the school size (that is total number of students per school) is directly proportional to the school’s budget. The per student budget does not seem to be directly impacted by student count.
•	Looking at the Spending Ranges (Per Student) data frame, seems the overall passing rate is inversely proportional to per student budget
Conclusion
District Schools had the highest student counts and highest school budget.
Charter school came in higher than district schools in the area or Math scores, Reading scores and overall passing. This could be as a result of, amongst other factors, a balanced teacher to student ratio.
